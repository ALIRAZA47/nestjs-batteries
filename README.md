# 🧰 Nestjs Batteries

A fully-configurable NestJS module that simplifies backend setup by bundling together:

- 🔐 JWT Authentication
- 🧠 Caching (Redis or In-Memory)
- 🗃️ Database Switching (MongoDB or SQL)
- 🔄 One-line module injection

This package is ideal for teams and solo devs who want to build **scalable backends faster**, without rebuilding auth, caching, or DB setup each time.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Plug-and-play JWT auth system
- ✅ Redis-based or in-memory cache layer
- ✅ Switchable support between MongoDB and SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Single, centralized configuration
- ✅ Easily extendable and override-friendly
- ✅ Zero boilerplate for auth/login setup
